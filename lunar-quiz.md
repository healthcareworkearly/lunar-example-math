### Multiple Choice Questions

1. **If an astronaut needs to calculate the number of orbits a satellite makes in a day, which Python loop structure is most suitable?**
   - A) `while`
   - B) `for`
   - C) `do-while`
   - D) `repeat-until`
   - **Answer:** B

2. **When observing stars through a telescope, a data analyst records the brightness of each star in a list. Which Python data type is best suited for storing this list of star brightness values?**
   - A) Integer
   - B) String
   - C) List
   - D) Dictionary
   - **Answer:** C

3. **To analyze data from a space mission, a function in Python is created. Which of the following is a valid function definition?**
   - A) `def analyzeData():`
   - B) `function analyzeData():`
   - C) `create analyzeData():`
   - D) `method analyzeData():`

### Fill in the Blank Questions

4. **In Python, the ________ statement is used to exit a loop when observing a rare event like the Northern Lights.**
   - **Answer:** break

5. **To store the names of different constellations viewed through a telescope, a Python ________ can be used.**
   - **Answer:** list

### Short Answer Questions

6. **Explain how a Python function could be used in calculating the phases of the Moon.**
   - **Answer:** A Python function can be written to calculate the Moon's phases by taking a date as input and computing the lunar phase for that date. The function can use algorithms based on the lunar cycle's duration to determine the current phase, such as New Moon, Waxing Crescent, Full Moon, etc.

7. **What is a tuple in Python, and how might it be relevant for storing space mission data?**
   - **Answer:** A tuple in Python is an immutable sequence type. It is relevant for storing space mission data that doesn't change, like the names of planets, or dates of significant astronomical events.

8. **How can a Python script help in visualizing data, such as the pattern of the Northern Lights?**
   - **Answer:** A Python script can use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to process and visualize data. For the Northern Lights, it can plot patterns or intensity over time, create heatmaps of occurrences, or even animate the movement and changes in the lights over a period.
