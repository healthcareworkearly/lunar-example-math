**Title:** Tracking the Fuel Consumption of a Space Shuttle

**Description:**  
Welcome to a slightly more challenging beginner-level algebra exercise! In this activity, you'll step into the shoes of a mission analyst at a space agency. Your task involves calculating the fuel consumption of a space shuttle during its journey. This exercise will help you understand basic algebraic equations and their applications in real-world scenarios, such as space travel.

Imagine a space shuttle that consumes fuel at different rates during various phases of its journey. You need to calculate the total fuel consumption for a specific leg of the mission.

**Exercise:**

1. During the launch phase, the shuttle consumes fuel at a rate of 2 kilograms per second for 150 seconds.
2. In the next phase, to exit Earth's atmosphere, the fuel consumption rate is 1.5 kilograms per second for 120 seconds.
3. Finally, to stabilize in orbit, the shuttle uses fuel at a rate of 0.5 kilograms per second for 300 seconds.

Calculate the total amount of fuel consumed during these phases. 

**Input-Output Example:**

- Launch Phase: 2 kg/s for 150 s
- Exit Atmosphere: 1.5 kg/s for 120 s
- Stabilization: 0.5 kg/s for 300 s
- Total Fuel Consumption = ?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Fuel for Each Phase:**
   - Launch Phase: 2 kg/s * 150 seconds = 300 kg
   - Exit Atmosphere: 1.5kg/s * 120 seconds = 180kg
   - Stabilization: 0.5 kg/s * 300s = 150kg

2. **Add the Fuel Amounts:**
   - Total Fuel Consumption = 300 kg (Launch) + 180 kg (Exit Atmosphere) + 150 kg (Stabilization)
   - Total Fuel Consumption = 630 kg

**Total Fuel Consumption:** 630 kilograms

**Reason for Exercise Creation:**  
This exercise is designed to introduce beginners to algebraic thinking by applying basic multiplication and addition in a context that is both interesting and relevant. The theme of space travel and the operation of a space shuttle make the exercise appealing to those interested in space exploration and science. It demonstrates how algebra is used in practical and exciting real-world situations, like calculating fuel for a space mission.

**Step-by-Step Explanation of the Solution:**

1. **Multiplying Rate by Time:**
   - For each phase, we multiply the fuel consumption rate (in kg/s) by the time duration of that phase (in seconds). This gives us the total fuel consumed in each phase.

2. **Adding Up the Total Fuel:**
   - We then add the fuel amounts from all three phases to find the total fuel consumption for the journey's leg.

By completing this exercise, students learn to apply basic algebraic operations (multiplication and addition) to solve problems, a skill that is fundamental in many real-world scenarios, including scientific and engineering fields.
